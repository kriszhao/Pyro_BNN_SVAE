# Pyro_BNN_SVAE
Probabilistic Programming in the Context of Neural Networks

Pyro is a probabilistic programming language built on Python as a platform for developing advanced probabilistic models in deep learning framework.To scale to large data sets and high-dimensional models, Pyro uses stochastic variational inference algorithms and probability distributions built on top of PyTorch.To accommodate complex or model-specific algorithmic behavior, Pyro leverages Poutine, a library of composable building blocks for modifying the behavior of probabilistic programs.
